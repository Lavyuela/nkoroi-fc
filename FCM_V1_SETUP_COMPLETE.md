## 🔔 How Notifications Work

### In Your App:
1. **App starts** → Registers for push notifications
2. **Gets Expo Push Token** → Unique identifier for this device
3. **Listens to Firestore** → Real-time updates from `notifications` collection
4. **Shows notifications** → Both when app is open and closed

### From Admin Panel:
1. **Admin creates notification** → Saved to Firestore
2. **Cloud Function triggers** → Sends push notification via Expo
3. **FCM V1 delivers** → Uses Firebase credentials
4. **User receives** → Notification appears on device

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Build

1. **Download APK** from the build link
2. **Install on phone** (enable "Install from unknown sources")
3. **Open the app** and grant notification permissions
4. **Test notifications** from https://expo.dev/notifications
5. **Test from admin panel** by creating a match update
6. **Share APK** with users or upload to Play Store

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If notifications don't work in APK:

1. **Check permissions**
   - Open app
   - Grant notification permissions when prompted
   - Check Settings → Apps → Nkoroi FC → Notifications

2. **Verify internet connection**
   - Notifications require internet
   - Works on WiFi or mobile data

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Go to Cloud Messaging dashboard
   - Verify messages are being sent

4. **Test with Expo tool first**
   - Use https://expo.dev/notifications
   - Confirms FCM V1 is working

### If build fails:

1. **Check build logs**
   ```bash
   npx eas build:list
   npx eas build:view [BUILD_ID]
   ```

2. **Verify credentials**
   ```bash
   npx eas credentials
   ```

3. **Check google-services.json**
   - Confirm file exists at `./android/app/google-services.json`
   - Verify package name matches
