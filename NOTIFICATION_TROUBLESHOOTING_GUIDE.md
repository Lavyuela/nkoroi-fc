## 🎯 How Notifications Work Now

### Topic-Based System:
- **All users** subscribe to `team_updates` topic on login
- Cloud Functions send notifications to the topic
- FCM delivers to all subscribed devices

### Notification Flow:
```
User Logs In → NotificationService.initialize() → Subscribe to 'team_updates' topic
                                                 ↓
Admin Creates Event → Cloud Function Triggered → Send to 'team_updates' topic
                                                 ↓
FCM → All Subscribed Devices → Notification Appears
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs (All Users)

When any user logs in, check for these logs:

```
🚀 User logged in, initializing notifications for: [userId]
Starting notification service initialization for user: [userId]
Requesting permissions...
✅ Permission granted
Creating notification channels...
✅ Channels created
Getting FCM token...
✅ FCM token obtained and saved
Subscribing to team_updates topic...
✅ Subscribed to topic: team_updates
✅ Topic subscription verified in Firestore
✅ Handlers set up
✅ Notification service initialized successfully
```

**If you see these logs → User is properly subscribed ✅**

### Step 2: Check Firestore

1. Open Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Go to `users` collection
3. Find the user document
4. Check for these fields:
   - `fcmToken`: Should have a long token string
   - `subscribedToTopics`: Should be an array containing `"team_updates"`
   - `lastTopicSubscription`: Should have a recent timestamp

**If these fields exist → User is subscribed ✅**

### Step 3: Test Notifications

#### Test 1: Pre-Match Announcement
1. Login as Admin/Super Admin
2. Go to any match → Pre-Match Announcement
3. Click "Share" button
4. Should see: "Success - Notification sent to all fans!"
5. **Check all devices** (Super Admin, Admin, Fan) - all should receive notification

#### Test 2: Lineup Announcement
1. Login as Admin/Super Admin
2. Go to any match → Create Lineup Graphic
3. Create lineup and click "Share"
4. Should see: "Success - Notification sent to all fans!"
5. **Check all devices** - all should receive notification

#### Test 3: Match Events
1. Start a match
2. Add goal → **All users** should receive: "45' ⚽ [Player Name] scores!"
3. Add yellow card → **All users** should receive: "30' 🟨 Yellow Card - [Player Name]"
4. Add substitution → **All users** should receive: "70' 🔄 Substitution - [Player OUT] OFF ➡️ [Player IN] ON"
