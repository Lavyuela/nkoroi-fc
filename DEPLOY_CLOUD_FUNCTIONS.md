## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Deployment:**

### **Step 1: Install Firebase CLI**

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
npm install -g firebase-tools

### **Step 3: Navigate to Project**

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"
```

---

### **Step 4: Initialize Firebase (if not done)**

```powershell

## 🧪 **Test It:**

### **Test 1: App is CLOSED ✅ NOW WORKS!**

1. **Device 1:** Open app, login as admin

- 1,000 × 30 days = **30,000 invocations/month**
- **Way below free tier!** ✅

### **Actual Cost:**
- **$0.00/month** (you're well within free tier)

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Error: "Billing account not configured"**
**Solution:** Firebase needs billing enabled for Cloud Functions
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Upgrade" (top right)
3. Select "Blaze Plan" (pay as you go)
4. **Don't worry:** You won't be charged (free tier is huge)
5. Add credit card (required but won't be charged)

### **Error: "Permission denied"**
**Solution:** Login again
```powershell
firebase logout
firebase login
```

### **Error: "Functions not deploying"**
**Solution:** Check Node.js version
```powershell
node --version
```
Should be v18 or higher.
