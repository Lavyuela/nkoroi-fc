# Final SHA Fix - Simple Steps

The APKs in your downloads seem to have issues. Here's the **absolute simplest solution**:

## Solution: Just Tell Me the SHA from GitHub Logs

### Step 1: Get SHA from GitHub Actions

1. **Open this link**: https://github.com/Lavyuela/nkoroi-fc/actions

2. **Click on the latest workflow** that says "Add SHA verification step to workflow"

3. **Click on the "build" job**

4. **Find the step**: "üîç Verify Keystore SHA Fingerprints"

5. **Copy the SHA1 and SHA256** values shown there

6. **Paste them here or tell me what they are**

### Step 2: I'll Add Them to Firebase for You

Once you give me the SHA values, I can:
- Tell you exactly where to add them in Firebase Console
- Or guide you through adding them step-by-step

## OR - Even Simpler: Use Your Current Working APK

If you have an APK that's already installed and working on a device:

1. That APK already has the correct SHA registered in Firebase
2. Just download that same APK again from the GitHub Actions run that created it
3. Distribute that APK to other users

## Current Status

**Your local debug keystore** (works for local builds):
- SHA1: `5E:8F:16:06:2E:A3:CD:2C:4A:0D:54:78:76:BA:A6:F3:8C:AB:F6:25`
- SHA256: `FA:C6:17:45:DC:09:03:78:6F:B9:ED:E6:2A:96:2B:39:9F:73:48:F0:BB:6F:89:9B:83:32:66:75:91:03:3B:9C`

**GitHub release keystore** (need to add to Firebase):
- SHA1: [Get from workflow logs]
- SHA256: [Get from workflow logs]

## What to Do Right Now

**Option 1**: Check the GitHub Actions logs and tell me the SHA values

**Option 2**: Just add both keystores' SHAs to Firebase:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nkoroifc-9c964/settings/general
2. Find your Android app
3. Click "Add fingerprint" 
4. Add any SHA you find in the workflow logs
5. Done!

Firebase supports multiple SHAs, so you can have as many as you want registered.

**Next**: Just tell me what SHA you see in the GitHub workflow logs and we'll add it to Firebase in 2 minutes.
