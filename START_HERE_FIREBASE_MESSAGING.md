## 📱 INSTALL AND TEST:

### **Step 1: Install APK**

- Uninstall old app completely
- Install new APK
- Open the app
- **Grant notification permission!**

### **Step 2: Get Your FCM Token**

The app will log it. Look for:
```
🔑 FCM Token: ...
```

**To see logs:**
```cmd
adb logcat | findstr "FCM Token"
```

Copy this token!

### **Step 3: Test Notifications**

#### **Test 1: Firestore (Easiest)**

1. Open the app
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
4. Add to `notifications` collection:
   ```
   title: "Test Notification"
   body: "Testing Firebase!"
   createdAt: [timestamp - Now]
   ```
5. **Notification appears!** 🎉

#### **Test 2: FCM Direct**

1. Edit `test-fcm-notification.js`
2. Paste your FCM token
3. Run:
   ```cmd
   node test-fcm-notification.js
   ```
4. **Notification appears!** 🎉

## 🎉 WHY THIS WILL WORK:

### **Pure Native Modules**
- No Expo build dependencies
- Works with GitHub Actions + Gradle
- Standard React Native Firebase

### **Proper Permissions**
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS for Android 13+
- Correct Firebase messaging service
- Notification channel configured

### **Dual Notification System**
