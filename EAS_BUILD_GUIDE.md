## 🎯 **Why This Works:**

| Build Method | FCM Configuration | Push When Closed |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| GitHub Actions | ❌ Broken | ❌ No (404 error) |
| EAS Build | ✅ Proper | ✅ Yes |

EAS Build uses Expo's infrastructure which properly configures:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Google Services
- FCM tokens (valid, not 404)
- Native Android push notifications

---

## 💰 **Cost:**

**FREE!** EAS has a free tier that includes:
- Unlimited builds
- 30 builds/month for free accounts
- More than enough for your needs

---

## 🐛 **If You Get Errors:**

### **Error: "Not logged in"**
Run: `eas login`

### **Error: "Project not configured"**
Run: `eas build:configure`

### **Error: "No Expo account"**
Create one at: https://expo.dev/signup

---

## 📊 **What Happens During Build:**

1. ✅ Code is uploaded to Expo servers
2. ✅ Native Android project is generated
3. ✅ Firebase is properly configured
4. ✅ FCM is set up correctly
5. ✅ APK is built with valid FCM tokens
6. ✅ You download the APK

---

## ✅ **After Installing EAS-Built APK:**

### **Test 1: Verify FCM Token**
1. Open the app
2. Check Firestore: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nkoroifc-9c964/firestore/data/users
3. Look for `fcmToken` field
4. It should be a long string (valid token!)

### **Test 2: Push Notification When Closed**
1. Close the app completely (swipe away)
2. Create a match/update on another device
3. **You WILL receive notification!** ✅

### **Test 3: Check Logs**
Run: `firebase functions:log`

You should see:
```
✅ Found FCM token for user
📤 Sending FCM notification to X devices
✅ Successfully sent: X
✅ Message sent successfully
```

**NO MORE 404 ERRORS!** ✅
