## üß™ STEP 3: Test Notifications on Your Phone

### In the same Command Prompt, run:
```cmd
npx expo start
```

### What happens:
- A QR code appears in the terminal
- Metro bundler starts
- You'll see a URL like: `exp://192.168.x.x:8081`

### On your phone:
1. Open **Expo Go** app (download from Play Store if you don't have it)
2. Scan the QR code from the terminal
3. App will load on your phone

### Watch the terminal logs:
Look for a line that says:
```
‚úÖ Expo Push Token: ExponentPushToken[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
```

**Copy this token!** You'll need it for testing.

## üì¨ STEP 4: Send Test Notification

### Open your web browser:
1. Go to: **https://expo.dev/notifications**

### Fill in the form:
- **Expo Push Token**: Paste the token you copied
- **Title**: `Test Notification`
- **Message**: `FCM V1 is working!`
- **Sound**: Leave as default

### Click: **"Send a Notification"**

### Check your phone:

## üèóÔ∏è STEP 5: Build APK with FCM V1

### In Command Prompt (same window):

First, stop the dev server:
```
Press: Ctrl + C
Type: Y
Press: Enter
```

### Now build the APK:
```cmd
npx eas build -p android --profile preview
```

### What happens:
- EAS will ask you to log in (if not already)
- Build will start (takes 10-15 minutes)
- You'll get a URL to track progress

### Track the build:
```cmd
npx eas build:list
```

### When build completes:
- You'll get a download link

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "npx is not recognized"
**Solution**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### "eas credentials" shows no FCM option
**Solution**: Update EAS CLI first:
```cmd
npm install -g eas-cli
```
Then try again:
```cmd
npx eas credentials
```

### "Cannot find service account file"
**Solution**: Make sure you use the full path:
```cmd
C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\nkoroifc-9c964-firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx.json
```
(Replace `xxxxx` with your actual filename)

### "Expo Go not connecting"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi
- Try tunnel mode:
```cmd
npx expo start --tunnel
```

### No push token appears
**Solution**:
- Use a physical device (not emulator)
- Grant notification permissions when prompted
- Restart the app
