## ❌ Current Issue: Windows File Locking

Every local Android build attempt fails with file access/locking errors:
- `java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException`
- `EBUSY: resource busy or locked`
- `Unable to delete directory`
- Files in `node_modules` locked by Windows processes

### Root Cause:
- Windows file system locks
- Gradle daemon holding files
- Node processes not releasing files
- Antivirus or system processes interfering

1. ❌ Regular build
2. ❌ Clean build
3. ❌ Kill Java processes
4. ❌ Delete and regenerate android folder
5. ❌ Reinstall dependencies
6. ❌ Build without clean
7. ❌ Computer restart
8. ❌ Multiple configuration fixes

cd "c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
**Time:** 15-30 minutes  
**Result:** Download link for signed APK

### Option 2: Use Existing APK
If you have the v1.0.1 APK from before:
- It works perfectly

## 💡 Why Local Builds Keep Failing:

### Windows File System Issues:
1. **Gradle Daemon** - Holds files open
2. **Node.js** - Locks node_modules files
3. **Antivirus** - Scans and locks files
4. **Windows Defender** - Real-time protection locks
5. **File Explorer** - Preview pane locks files
6. **VS Code** - Language servers lock files
7. **Background processes** - Various system services

### This is a Known Issue:
- Common with React Native/Expo on Windows
- Not your fault or code issue
- Cloud builds (EAS) avoid this completely
