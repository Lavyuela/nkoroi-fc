# 🔐 Persistent Login - Stay Logged In

## ✅ Feature Added

**You no longer need to enter your login credentials every time!**

The app now remembers your login and keeps you signed in automatically.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### First Time Login:
1. Open app
2. Enter email and password
3. Tap "Login"
4. **Session is saved automatically**

### Next Time You Open App:
1. Open app
2. **Automatically logged in!** ✨
3. Go straight to Home screen

---

## 🔄 What's Saved

When you login, the app saves:
- ✅ Your email
- ✅ Your user ID
- ✅ Your admin status
- ❌ **NOT your password** (secure!)

**Stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage**

---

## 🚪 Logging Out

### To Logout:
1. Go to Account screen (tap profile icon)
2. Scroll down
3. Tap "Logout" button
4. **Session is cleared**
5. Next time you'll need to login again

**Or:**
- Uninstall and reinstall app
- Clear app data

---

## 🔒 Security

### Is It Safe?
✅ **Yes!** Your password is never stored
✅ Only session data is saved locally
✅ Data is encrypted by AsyncStorage
✅ Only accessible by your app

### When Session Expires:
- Session stays active until you logout
- Or until you uninstall the app
- Or until you clear app data
