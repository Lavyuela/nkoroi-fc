# 🔧 Fix Super Admin Issue

## Problem
- `mangajuliah5@gmail.com` (second user) was incorrectly made Super Admin
- App crashes when going to Account screen
- Only `ivy.waliaula@gmail.com` (first user) should be Super Admin

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Account Screen Crash
**Issue:** `setUser` and `setIsAdmin` functions didn't exist in component
**Fix:** Changed to use `clearUserSession()` from AuthContext

### 2. Fixed Super Admin Registration
**Issue:** Second user was also becoming Super Admin
**Fix:** Now checks if user list is empty BEFORE adding new user

## 🎯 How to Fix Current Situation

### Option 1: Clear App Data (EASIEST)
```
1. Settings → Apps → Nkoroi FC
2. Storage → Clear Data
3. Open app
4. Register ivy.waliaula@gmail.com first (becomes Super Admin)
5. Register mangajuliah5@gmail.com second (becomes Fan)
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix via ADB
```bash
# Connect device via USB
adb devices

# Access app storage
adb shell run-as com.nkoroifc

# View current super admins
cat shared_prefs/RCTAsyncLocalStorage_V1.xml | grep superAdmins

# You'll need to manually edit the XML to remove mangajuliah5@gmail.com
# Or use Option 1 (Clear Data) which is easier
```

### Option 3: Reinstall App
```
1. Uninstall Nkoroi FC
2. Install new APK (after it builds)
3. Register ivy.waliaula@gmail.com first
4. Register mangajuliah5@gmail.com second
```

## 📱 Expected Behavior After Fix

### First User (ivy.waliaula@gmail.com):
- ✅ Super Admin
- ✅ See "👑 Super Admin Mode"
- ✅ Dashboard button visible
- ✅ Can manage all users

### Second User (mangajuliah5@gmail.com):
- ✅ Fan (regular user)
- ✅ No admin badge
- ✅ No Dashboard button
- ✅ Can view matches, make predictions

### Account Screen:
- ✅ No crash
- ✅ Shows correct role badge
