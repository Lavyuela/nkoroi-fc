## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Upload FCM Credentials to EAS

You need to link your Firebase credentials with Expo/EAS:

```bash
npx eas credentials
```

**Follow these prompts:**
1. Select platform: **Android**
2. Select action: **Upload FCM key** (or similar option)
3. You'll need your Firebase Server Key:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project: **nkoroifc-9c964**
   - Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon) ‚Üí **Cloud Messaging** tab
   - Find **Server key** or **Legacy server key**
   - Copy and paste it when prompted

> **Note:** If you don't see the FCM key option, you may need to enable Cloud Messaging API in Google Cloud Console.

### Step 2: Test Notifications on Physical Device

#### 2a. Start the Development Server

```bash
npx expo start
```

#### 2b. Open on Your Phone
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go app
- Watch the terminal/logs for your **Expo Push Token**
- It will look like: `ExponentPushToken[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]`

#### 2c. Send a Test Notification
1. Go to: https://expo.dev/notifications
2. Paste your Expo Push Token
3. Enter a title and message
4. Click **Send a Notification**
5. You should receive it on your phone! üéâ

### Step 3: Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging API

If you encounter issues with FCM:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **nkoroifc-9c964**
3. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
4. Search for **Firebase Cloud Messaging API**
5. Click **Enable**

### Step 4: Build Your APK with Notifications

Once testing works in Expo Go, build your APK:

```bash
npx eas build -p android --profile preview
```

This will:
- Include your `google-services.json`
- Bundle Firebase configuration
- Enable push notifications in the standalone APK

- Check that notification permissions are granted
- Restart the app and check logs

### Notifications Not Received
- Verify FCM credentials are uploaded to EAS
- Check Firebase Cloud Messaging API is enabled
- Ensure app has notification permissions
- Check device is connected to internet

### Build Fails
