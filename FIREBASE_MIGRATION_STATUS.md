# 🔥 Firebase Migration Status

## ✅ **Code Migration: COMPLETE**

All code has been migrated to use Firebase! Here's what's done:

### **Migrated Files:**
- ✅ `src/services/firebaseService.js` - New Firebase service (replaces old firebase.js)
- ✅ `src/context/AuthContext.js` - Uses Firebase Auth
- ✅ `src/screens/LoginScreen.js` - Uses Firebase Auth
- ✅ `src/screens/RegisterScreen.js` - Uses Firebase Auth
- ✅ `src/screens/AccountScreen.js` - Uses Firebase Auth
- ✅ `src/screens/HomeScreen.js` - Uses Firebase Firestore
- ✅ `src/screens/UserManagementScreen.js` - Uses Firebase Firestore

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: You Need New APK!**

### **Current Situation:**
- ✅ Code is updated to use Firebase
- ❌ Your current APK still uses OLD AsyncStorage code
- ❌ That's why you're seeing "Fan" instead of "Super Admin"
- ❌ That's why login on second device doesn't work

### **Solution:**
**You MUST build and install a NEW APK with the Firebase code!**

---

## 🚀 **How to Get New APK:**

### **Option 1: GitHub Actions (Automatic)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Lavyuela/nkoroi-fc/actions
2. Look for: "Phase 1: Migrate authentication and user management to Firebase"
3. Wait ~15 minutes for build to complete
4. Download the APK
5. Install on both devices

### **Option 2: Build Locally**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

---

## 📱 **After Installing New APK:**

### **Step 1: Clear Old Data**
Since you already registered with the old system, you need to:
1. **Uninstall** the old app from both devices
2. **Install** the new APK
3. **Open** the app (fresh start)

### **Step 2: Register First User (Super Admin)**
1. **Device 1:** Open app
2. **Register:** ivy.waliaula@gmail.com
3. **Result:** ✅ Super Admin (first user in Firebase)
4. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - Go to: Firestore Database
   - Collection: `roles`
   - Should see: `ivy.waliaula@gmail.com` with `role: super_admin`

### **Step 3: Test Cross-Device Login**
1. **Device 2:** Open app
2. **Login:** ivy.waliaula@gmail.com (same account)
3. **Result:** ✅ Super Admin (same user from Firebase)
4. **Both devices:** Should show "👑 Super Admin Mode"

### **Step 4: Register Second User**
1. **Device 2:** Logout
2. **Register:** second@gmail.com
3. **Result:** ✅ Fan (default role)
4. **Device 1 (Super Admin):**
   - Go to User Management
   - Find second@gmail.com
   - Promote to Admin ✅

### **Step 5: Verify Sync**
1. **Device 1:** Create a match
2. **Device 2:** Should see match instantly ✅
3. **Device 1:** Promote user to Admin
4. **Device 2:** Logout and login → See Admin role ✅

## 🔍 **How to Verify Firebase is Working:**

### **Check 1: Firebase Console - Authentication**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select: Nkoroi FC project
3. Click: Authentication
4. Should see: Registered users

### **Check 2: Firebase Console - Firestore**
1. Click: Firestore Database
2. Collections should exist:
   - `users` - User profiles
   - `roles` - User roles (super_admin, admin, fan)
   - `matches` - Matches (when created)

### **Check 3: App Logs**
When you register/login, you should see in logs:
```
✅ User registered: ivy.waliaula@gmail.com as super_admin
✅ User logged in: ivy.waliaula@gmail.com (super_admin)
```

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

### **First User (ivy.waliaula@gmail.com):**
```
Device 1: Register → Super Admin ✅
Device 2: Login → Super Admin ✅ (same account)
Both devices: See "👑 Super Admin Mode"
```

### **Second User (any other email):**
```
Any device: Register → Fan ✅
Super Admin: Can promote to Admin ✅
Login on any device: Same role everywhere ✅
```

### **Cross-Device Sync:**
```
Device 1: Create match → Saved to Firebase
Device 2: See match instantly ✅
Device 1: Update score → Firebase updates
Device 2: See score update instantly ✅
```

### **Push Notifications:**
```
Device 1: Create match → Firebase Cloud Messaging
Device 2: Receive notification ✅
All users: Get notified of match updates ✅
```

## 📋 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Issue: Still seeing "Fan" after registration**
**Cause:** Using old APK with AsyncStorage
**Fix:** Install new APK from GitHub Actions

### **Issue: Can't login on second device**
**Cause:** User exists in AsyncStorage on Device 1, not in Firebase
**Fix:** Uninstall old app, install new APK, register again

### **Issue: No users in Firebase Console**
**Cause:** Old APK still using AsyncStorage
**Fix:** Install new APK and register

### **Issue: Both users are Fans**
**Cause:** Old APK doesn't have Super Admin logic
**Fix:** Install new APK, first user becomes Super Admin
