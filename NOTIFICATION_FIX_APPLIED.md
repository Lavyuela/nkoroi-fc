# 🔧 Notification Fix Applied

## ❌ Problem Found:
The Android notification channel was being created INSIDE the async function, which meant it might not be ready when notifications tried to show.

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Moved Notification Channel Setup**
- Now creates the Android notification channel IMMEDIATELY when app starts
- Happens BEFORE trying to show any notifications
- This ensures the channel exists when Firestore notifications arrive

### 2. **Added Debug Logging**
- Shows when notification listener starts
- Logs every Firestore snapshot received
- Shows notification timestamps and comparison
- Indicates whether notification will be shown or skipped
- Logs success/error for each notification

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### **1. Rebuild the APK**

Go to: https://github.com/Lavyuela/nkoroi-fc/actions

1. Click "Build Android APK"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Wait 10 minutes
4. Download new APK

### **2. Install New APK**

- Uninstall old version (if needed)
- Install new APK
- Open the app

### **3. Test Notifications**

**IMPORTANT SEQUENCE:**

1. **Open the app FIRST**
2. **Wait 10 seconds** (let it initialize)
3. **Keep app open** (in foreground)
4. **Go to Firestore** and add notification:
   ```
   title: "Test After Fix"
   body: "This should work now!"
   createdAt: [timestamp - Now]
   ```
5. **Watch your phone** - notification should appear!

### **4. Check Logs (Optional)**

If you want to see what's happening:

1. Connect phone via USB
2. Enable USB debugging
3. Run: `adb logcat | grep -E "📬|✅|❌|🔔"`
4. You'll see all notification activity

## 🔍 What the Logs Will Show:

```
🔔 Notification listener started at: 2025-10-13T...
📥 Firestore snapshot received, changes: 1
📬 New notification detected: { title: "Test", ... }
📬 Showing notification: Test
✅ Notification shown successfully
```

## 🎯 Why This Should Work Now:

1. ✅ Notification channel created immediately
2. ✅ Channel ready before any notifications
3. ✅ Better error handling
4. ✅ Debug logs to troubleshoot
5. ✅ FCM V1 credentials included

## ⚠️ Remember:

- **Open app BEFORE creating notification** in Firestore
- Notifications only show if created AFTER app starts
- This prevents showing old notifications on app launch

## 🆘 If Still Not Working:

Check the logs and look for:
- `❌ Error showing notification:` - Shows what went wrong
- `⏭️ Skipping old notification` - Notification was created before app started
- `⚠️ No snapshot received` - Firestore connection issue

---

**Rebuild the APK now and test!** The notification channel fix should resolve the issue.
