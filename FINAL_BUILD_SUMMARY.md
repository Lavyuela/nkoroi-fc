---

## ❌ Build Challenges Encountered:

### Local Windows Build Issues:
1. **File Locking** - Windows locks files in `node_modules`
2. **Access Denied** - Even with Defender disabled
3. **Build Folders** - Can't delete intermediate build files
4. **80+ Processes Killed** - Still failed
5. **Antivirus Exclusion** - Didn't help

### Root Cause:
- Windows file system locks at kernel level
- Background services (indexing, protection, etc.)
- Gradle can't delete/recreate build folders
- Not a code issue - system limitation

### EAS Build Issues:
- Tar extraction failed
- Upload/compression issues
- Takes 80+ minutes

## 🚀 Solution: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### Why WSL Works:
- ✅ Linux file system (no Windows locks)

./wsl-setup.sh
```

**Wait 20-30 minutes for setup**

### Step 3: Build APK
```bash
chmod +x wsl-build.sh
./wsl-build.sh
