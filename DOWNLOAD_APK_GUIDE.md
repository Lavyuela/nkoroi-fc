## üîí **Is The APK Safe?**

**YES! 100% Safe!** Here's why:

‚úÖ **You built it** - It's YOUR code
‚úÖ **Open source** - All code is visible on GitHub
‚úÖ **No malware** - Just React Native + Firebase
‚úÖ **False positive** - Unsigned APKs trigger warnings

**The warning is because:**
- APK is not signed by Google Play
- Downloaded from GitHub (not Play Store)
- Browser doesn't recognize the source

**Your APK contains:**
- React Native code (JavaScript)
- Firebase SDK (Google's library)
- Expo framework (trusted)
- Your app logic (Super Admin feature)

**Nothing malicious!**
