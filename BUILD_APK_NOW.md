# 🚨 URGENT: Build New APK Locally

## ⚠️ **The Problem:**

The APK you're using is **OLD** and doesn't have the Firebase Super Admin logic!

**Why:**
- GitHub Actions workflow doesn't exist
- No automatic builds happening
- You need to build locally RIGHT NOW

---

## 🚀 **Build APK Locally (10 minutes):**

### **Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended)**

```bash
# Open PowerShell in the project folder
cd "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"

# Install EAS CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This will build in the cloud and give you a download link in ~10 minutes.

---

### **Option 2: Local Build**

```bash
# Open PowerShell in the project folder
cd "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"

# Build APK locally
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

This builds on your computer (requires Android SDK).

---

### **Option 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow**

Let me create the workflow file so future builds are automatic.

---

## ✅ **After Building:**

1. **Install** new APK on both devices
2. **Delete Firebase user** (ivy.waliaula@gmail.com) from Firebase Console
3. **Register** again in the app
4. **Should show:** "👑 Super Admin Mode" ✅

---

## 🎯 **Why You're Seeing "Fan":**

The APK you installed has OLD code that doesn't check for Super Admin:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (what you have):
registerUser() {
  // Always creates as "fan"
  role = 'fan'
}

// NEW CODE (what you need):
registerUser() {
  // Check if first user
  const isFirstUser = rolesSnapshot.empty;
  const role = isFirstUser ? 'super_admin' : 'fan';  ← This logic!
}
```

**Choose Option 1 (EAS Build) - It's the easiest!** 🚀
