## 🎯 **What You're Experiencing Now:**

```
Current Situation (OLD APK):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Device 1 (OLD APK)         │
│  ├── AsyncStorage (local)   │
│  ├── ivy@gmail.com → Fan    │
│  └── No Firebase ❌         │
└─────────────────────────────┘

When you try to register:

```

## ✅ **What Will Happen with NEW APK:**

```
After Installing NEW APK:
┌─────────────────────────────┐

│  ├── Firebase Auth          │
│  ├── Firebase Firestore     │
│  └── Fresh start ✅         │

## ⏱️ **Estimated Time:**

- Install on both devices: 2 minutes
- Test registration: 1 minute
- **Total: ~20-25 minutes**

---

## 🆘 **If Build Failed:**

If you see a red X (❌) on GitHub Actions:

1. Let me know and I'll check the error
2. I can fix it and trigger a new build
3. Or I can help you build locally

---

## 📱 **Alternative: Build Locally**

If you don't want to wait for GitHub Actions:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

This will build the APK on your computer (takes ~10 minutes).

---

## ✅ **Bottom Line:**

**You CANNOT use Firebase features with the OLD APK!**

**You MUST:**
1. ✅ Download NEW APK from GitHub Actions
2. ✅ Uninstall OLD app
3. ✅ Install NEW APK
4. ✅ Register fresh

**Only then will Firebase work!** 🔥✅
