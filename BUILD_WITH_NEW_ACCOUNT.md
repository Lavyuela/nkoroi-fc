```

When prompted:
- **Project name**: `nkoroi-fc-live-score` (or any name you want)
- **Confirm**: Yes

### **Step 5: Re-upload FCM V1 Credentials**

```cmd
npx eas build -p android --profile preview

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Created new Expo account at expo.dev/signup
- [ ] Logged out: `npx eas logout`
- [ ] Logged in with new account: `npx eas login`
- [ ] Initialized project: `npx eas init`
- [ ] Uploaded FCM V1 credentials: `npx eas credentials`
- [ ] Started build: `npx eas build -p android --profile preview`

## üîÑ Alternative: Use Different Email Aliases

If you don't want to create a completely new email:

**Gmail users can use aliases:**
- Original: `yourname@gmail.com`
- Alias 1: `yourname+expo1@gmail.com`
- Alias 2: `yourname+expo2@gmail.com`

All emails go to the same inbox, but Expo treats them as different accounts!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Your FCM V1 Setup is Safe
- The service account JSON file is still on your computer
- You just need to re-upload it to the new Expo account
- Takes 2 minutes with `npx eas credentials`

### Your Code is Safe
- All your code stays the same
- No changes needed to app.json or App.js
- Just linking to a different Expo account

### Your Firebase is Safe
- Firebase project stays the same
- google-services.json stays the same
- Notifications will work exactly the same

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Project already exists"
If `eas init` says project exists:
```cmd
npx eas init --force
```

### "Cannot find credentials"
After switching accounts, you need to re-upload FCM:
```cmd
npx eas credentials
```

### "Build still fails"
Make sure you're logged in with the NEW account:
```cmd
npx eas whoami
```

Should show your new username, not "lavyuela"

---

## üí° Pro Tip

After building successfully, you can switch back to your original account later if needed. The APK will continue to work regardless of which Expo account built it!
