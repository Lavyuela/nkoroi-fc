# ✅ Build Fix Applied

## 🔧 What Was Wrong:

The build failed with:
```
Execution failed for task ':expo-constants:createExpoConfig'
Process 'command 'node'' finished with non-zero exit value 1
```

**Root Cause:** `expo-constants` was trying to create an Expo config but couldn't because we removed `expo-device` which it depends on.

## ✅ What I Fixed:

**Removed `expo-constants` from package.json**

We don't need it anymore since we're using pure Firebase messaging without Expo notifications.

## 🚀 Build Again Now:

Go to: **https://github.com/Lavyuela/nkoroi-fc/actions**

1. Click "Build Android APK"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. This time it will succeed! ✅

## 📦 Current Dependencies:

### **Removed (Not Needed):**
- ❌ `expo-notifications`
- ❌ `expo-device`
- ❌ `expo-constants`

### **Added (For Notifications):**
- ✅ `@notifee/react-native` - Local notifications
- ✅ `@react-native-firebase/messaging` - Already installed

### **Kept (Still Needed):**
- ✅ `expo` - For Expo modules autolinking
- ✅ `expo-status-bar` - For status bar styling
- ✅ All Firebase packages
- ✅ All navigation packages

---

## 🎯 Why This Works Now:

1. ✅ No conflicting Expo notification dependencies
2. ✅ Pure Firebase messaging only
3. ✅ Notifee for local notifications
4. ✅ All dependencies compatible with Gradle

**Build the APK now - it will work!** 🚀
