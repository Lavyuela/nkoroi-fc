## 🚀 To Get Your APK (When You're Ready)

### **Option 1: EAS Build (Cloud - Recommended)**

The build keeps failing due to configuration issues. Here's what to try:

1. **Make sure you're logged into Expo:**
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

2. **Try building with auto-configuration:**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview --auto-submit
   ```

3. **Or check the online dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://expo.dev
   - Login and check if any builds are queued/failed
   - View detailed error logs there

### **Option 2: Local Build (Your Computer)**

This takes longer but works:

1. **Make sure Java is installed** (already done ✅)
2. **Run the build:**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC\android"
   $env:JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-17.0.9.8-hotspot"
   .\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
   ```
3. **Wait 20-30 minutes** (first build is slow)
4. **Find APK at:** `android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`

### **Option 3: Get Help from Expo Community**

Post on Expo forums with your error:
- Forum: https://forums.expo.dev
- Discord: https://chat.expo.dev
- They can help debug the specific build error

## 📱 Testing Right Now (Works Perfectly!)
