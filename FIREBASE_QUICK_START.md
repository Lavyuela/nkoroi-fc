# 🔥 Firebase Quick Start - 15 Minutes to Cross-Device Sync

## 🎯 The Problem You're Facing

Right now:
- ❌ Each device has its own data (AsyncStorage)
- ❌ User registered on Device 1 ≠ User on Device 2
- ❌ Both devices can have Super Admins
- ❌ Matches don't sync between devices
- ❌ Notifications don't sync

## ✅ The Solution: Firebase

After Firebase:
- ✅ All devices share the same data
- ✅ One user account works on all devices
- ✅ Only ONE Super Admin across all devices
- ✅ Matches sync in real-time
- ✅ Notifications work everywhere
