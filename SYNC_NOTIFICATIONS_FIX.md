# 🔔 Fix Notification Sync Across Devices

## Problem
Notifications are not syncing across devices because some users are not subscribed to the `team_updates` topic.

## Solution (NO APK NEEDED!)

### ✅ What Was Done:

1. **Added Auto-Subscribe Cloud Function** (`onUserTokenUpdate`)
   - Automatically subscribes users when they open the app
   - Triggers when FCM token is saved/updated
   - Works for ALL users without app update

2. **Created Manual Subscription Script**
   - One-time script to subscribe ALL existing users
   - Run this to immediately fix all current users

---

## 🚀 How to Fix Immediately (Run Once)

### Step 1: Get Firebase Service Account Key

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nkoroifc-9c964/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Save the file as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the `functions` folder

### Step 2: Run the Subscription Script

```bash
cd functions
node subscribeAllUsers.js
```

This will:
- Find all users in Firestore
- Subscribe their FCM tokens to `team_updates` topic
- Update their records to mark as subscribed
- Show a summary of results

## 📊 Expected Output

```
🚀 Starting to subscribe all users to team_updates topic...

📊 Found 25 users

✅ Subscribed user abc123 to team_updates
✅ Subscribed user def456 to team_updates
✅ User ghi789 already subscribed
⏭️  Skipping user jkl012 - no FCM token
...

📊 Summary:
✅ Successfully subscribed: 20
⏭️  Skipped: 3
❌ Errors: 2
📊 Total users: 25
```

## 🔄 How It Works Going Forward

### For New Users:
1. User opens app → FCM token generated
2. Token saved to Firestore
3. Cloud Function `onUserTokenUpdate` triggers
4. User automatically subscribed to `team_updates`
5. ✅ User receives all notifications

### For Existing Users:
1. User opens app → FCM token refreshed
2. Token updated in Firestore
3. Cloud Function `onUserTokenUpdate` triggers
4. User automatically subscribed to `team_updates`
5. ✅ User receives all notifications

---

## ✅ Benefits

- **No APK update needed** - Server-side fix only
- **Automatic** - Works for all users when they open the app
- **Persistent** - Once subscribed, stays subscribed
- **Cross-device** - All devices with the app get notifications

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Check if user is subscribed
```javascript
// In Firestore, check user document
{
  fcmToken: "...",
  subscribedToTopics: ["team_updates"],  // ✅ Should have this
  lastTopicSubscription: "2025-10-21..."
}
```

### Test 2: Send test notification
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Test Notifications"
3. All subscribed users should receive it

### Test 3: Match event notification
1. Create a match event (goal, card, etc.)
2. All users should receive notification
3. Check on multiple devices
