## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Repository Must Be Public
- Free GitHub Actions only for public repos
- Your code will be visible (but that's okay!)
- Or pay $4/month for private repos

### Build Time
- First build: 10-15 minutes
- Subsequent builds: 8-12 minutes
- Much faster than local builds!

### Storage
- GitHub stores artifacts for 90 days
- Download APK within 90 days
- Or it gets deleted (just rebuild)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Actions tab for error
2. Read error message
3. Fix issue in code
4. Push again

### If Git Not Installed:
1. Download from: https://git-scm.com
2. Install
3. Restart terminal
4. Try again

### If Push Rejected:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push
```
