## ⚠️ Current Issue: Phone Loading

**Problem:** App loads on phone but takes very long / shows white screen

**Likely Causes:**
1. First-time bundle download is large
2. Network speed/connectivity
3. Phone and computer network configuration

---

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get App Running

### Option A: Try Again Tomorrow (Recommended First)

**Why this often works:**
- Fresh network conditions
- Computer restart clears issues
- Better performance after rest

**Steps:**
1. **Restart your computer**
2. **Update Expo Go** on your phone (App Store/Play Store)
3. **Open Command Prompt** and run:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"
   npm start
   ```
4. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for first load

---

### Option B: Build APK (If Option A doesn't work)

**This creates a standalone Android app file**

#### Step 1: Create Expo Account
1. Go to: https://expo.dev/signup
2. Sign up with email (free)
3. Verify your email

#### Step 2: Login to EAS
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Nkoroi FC"
npx eas login
```
Enter your Expo credentials

#### Step 3: Build APK
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This will:
- Upload your code to Expo servers
- Build the APK (takes 10-20 minutes)
- Give you a download link

#### Step 4: Install on Phone
1. Download the APK file from the link
2. Transfer to your phone (email, USB, or direct download)
3. Install the APK
4. Open "Nkoroi FC Live Score" app

### Option C: Try Different Network

**Use Mobile Hotspot:**
1. Create hotspot on a different phone
