# üö® PUSH NOTIFICATIONS - FINAL FIX

## ‚ùå **Why It's Not Working Right Now:**

You're using the **OLD APK** that doesn't have the FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) code!

The old APK only has basic Firestore notifications that don't work when the app is closed.

---

## ‚úÖ **What I Just Fixed:**

1. ‚úÖ **Added FCM token code** to the app (gets device token)
2. ‚úÖ **Deployed Cloud Functions** to Firebase (sends FCM messages)
3. ‚úÖ **Fixed message format bug** in Cloud Function
4. ‚úÖ **Triggered new APK build** on GitHub Actions

---

## üì± **What You Need To Do:**

### **Step 1: Wait for New APK (12 minutes)**

GitHub Actions is building the NEW APK right now.

Check status: https://github.com/Lavyuela/nkoroi-fc/actions

When it's done, you'll see a green checkmark ‚úÖ

### **Step 2: Download the NEW APK**

1. Go to: https://github.com/Lavyuela/nkoroi-fc/actions
2. Click the latest workflow run (top one)
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
4. Download **"app-release"**
5. Extract the ZIP file
6. You'll get: `app-release.apk`

### **Step 3: Install NEW APK**

1. **Uninstall the old app** from your phone (important!)
2. Transfer `app-release.apk` to your phone
3. Install it
4. Open the app
5. **Grant notification permission** when prompted

### **Step 4: Verify FCM Token**

When you open the app, check the console logs (if you can see them).

You should see:
```
‚úÖ FCM permission granted
‚úÖ FCM Token: [long string]
‚úÖ FCM token saved to Firestore
```

If you don't see this, the app isn't getting the FCM token.

### **Step 5: Test Notifications**

**Test 1: App Open**
1. Device 1: Create a match
2. Device 2: Should see notification ‚úÖ

**Test 2: App Closed** (THE IMPORTANT ONE!)
1. Device 2: **Close app completely** (swipe away from recent apps)
2. Device 1: Create a match
3. Device 2: **Should receive notification!** ‚úÖ

---

## üîç **How To Verify It's Working:**

### **Check 1: FCM Tokens in Firestore**

Go to Firebase Console:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nkoroifc-9c964/firestore/data/users

Click on a user document. You should see:
- `fcmToken`: "long string here"
- `fcmTokenUpdatedAt`: timestamp

If you don't see `fcmToken`, the NEW APK isn't installed!

### **Check 2: Cloud Function Logs**

Run: `firebase functions:log`

Or go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nkoroifc-9c964/functions/logs

When you create a notification, you should see:
```
üì¨ New notification created
üì¢ Title: [notification title]
üì§ Sending notification to X devices...
‚úÖ Successfully sent: X
```

If you see errors, tell me what they are.

## üéØ **The Complete Flow:**

```
Admin creates match
  ‚Üì
App calls sendPushNotificationToAllUsers()
  ‚Üì
Creates document in Firestore /notifications collection
  ‚Üì
Cloud Function "sendNotification" triggers automatically
  ‚Üì
Function reads all users from Firestore
  ‚Üì
Gets their FCM tokens
  ‚Üì
Sends FCM message to Google's servers
  ‚Üì
Google delivers to devices (even if app is closed!)
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ USER SEES NOTIFICATION
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Issues:**

### **Issue 1: "No FCM tokens found"**
**Cause:** Old APK installed  
**Solution:** Install NEW APK from GitHub Actions

### **Issue 2: "Function not triggering"**
**Cause:** Cloud Function not deployed  
**Solution:** Already deployed! Should work now.

### **Issue 3: "Invalid message format"**
**Cause:** Bug in Cloud Function  
**Solution:** Already fixed! Redeployed at 08:43.

### **Issue 4: "Permission denied"**
**Cause:** User didn't grant notification permission  
**Solution:** Open app, grant permission when prompted

## üìä **Timeline:**

- **08:35** - First test, found message format bug
- **08:43** - Fixed and redeployed Cloud Function
- **11:44** - You tested but using OLD APK (no FCM tokens)
- **11:56** - Pushed fix, triggered NEW APK build
- **~12:08** - NEW APK should be ready

---

## ‚úÖ **After Installing NEW APK:**

**Notifications will work:**
- ‚úÖ When app is OPEN
- ‚úÖ When app is in BACKGROUND
- ‚úÖ When app is COMPLETELY CLOSED üéâ
- ‚úÖ When phone is LOCKED üéâ

**Cost:** $0.00/month (within free tier)

---

## üÜò **If It Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check FCM tokens exist** in Firestore (see Check 1 above)
2. **Check Cloud Function logs** (see Check 2 above)
3. **Share the logs with me** so I can see the exact error

---

**The fix is complete. You just need to install the NEW APK!**

**ETA: ~12 minutes from now (12:08 PM)**
